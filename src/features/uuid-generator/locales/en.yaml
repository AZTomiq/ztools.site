    v1:
      title: Version 1 (Time-based/MAC)
      content: Version 1 is generated based on the current time and the device's MAC address. Suitable when uniqueness is required across time and space.
    v4:
      title: Version 4 (Random)
      content: Version 4 is generated purely randomly. This is the most common version, ensuring extremely high uniqueness with near-zero collision probability.
    v7:
      title: Version 7 (Time-sorted)
      content: Version 7 is similar to v1 but time-ordered, highly optimized for use as Primary Keys in databases.
