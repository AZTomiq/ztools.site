# How to use the Overtime (OT) Calculator

This tool helps you estimate your overtime pay accurately according to the **Vietnam Labor Law**.

### 1. Basic Information
- **Monthly Gross Salary**: Enter your current gross salary (on which social insurance is calculated).
- **Working Days/Month**: Usually 26 or 24 days.
- **Working Hours/Day**: Usually 8 hours.

### 2. Enter OT Hours
Split your overtime hours into appropriate categories:
- **Weekdays (150% - 210%)**: Standard working days from Monday to Saturday.
- **Weekends (200% - 270%)**: Usually Sunday.
- **Holidays/Tet (300% - 390%)**: Official public holidays.

### 3. Understanding Night Shift OT
According to Article 98 of the Labor Code 2019:
- **Night shift OT pay** = (Daytime OT Rate) + (30% Basic hourly rate) + (20% Daytime OT rate).
- This results in higher multipliers (e.g., 210% for weekday nights).
