# How to use the Investment ROI Calculator

This tool calculates your Total Return on Investment (ROI) and Annualized Return (CAGR) to evaluate how well your investment is performing.

### 1. Enter Values
- **Initial Investment**: The total amount you originally invested (Base capital + fees).
- **Final Value**: The current value of the investment or the price you sold it for.
- **Holding Period**: How many years you have held the investment (can use decimals like 1.5 years).

### 2. Key Metrics
- **Total ROI**: The simple percentage return over the entire period.
- **Annualized Return (CAGR)**: This is the most important metric. It tells you the average yearly growth rate, allowing you to compare different investments (e.g., Stock vs. Real Estate vs. Savings) fairly.

### 3. Example
If you buy a stock for 100M and sell it for 150M after 3 years:
- **Total ROI**: 50%
- **Annualized Return**: ~14.47% (meaning the investment grew by an average of 14.47% each year).
