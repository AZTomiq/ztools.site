# How to use the Freelancer & Business Tax Calculator

This tool helps freelancers and small business owners in Vietnam estimate their tax obligations.

### 1. Choose Calculation Mode
- **Personal (Withholding 10%)**: Use this for one-time service contracts, freelance gigs, or commissions where the payer deducts 10% PIT before paying you.
- **Business Household (HKD)**: Use this if you are registered as a business household (Hộ kinh doanh cá thể) paying "flat tax" based on revenue.

### 2. Enter Information
- **Total Amount**: The gross amount written in your contract or your total revenue.
- **Business Sector** (For HKD mode): Select the industry that matches your business license, as tax rates vary:
    - *Distribution*: 1.5% total (1% VAT, 0.5% PIT).
    - *Services/Consulting*: 7% total (5% VAT, 2% PIT).
    - *Construction/Production*: 4.5% total (3% VAT, 1.5% PIT).

### 3. Important Notes
- **Withholding 10%**: Only applies to contracts of 2,000,000 VND or more.
- **100M Threshold**: For Business Households, you are only liable for VAT and PIT if your total annual revenue exceeds 100 million VND.
- **Form 08**: If your total annual income is estimated to be below the taxable threshold (approx 132M/year with no dependents), you can submit a commitment form to avoid the 10% withholding.
