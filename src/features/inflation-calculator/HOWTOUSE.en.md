# How to use the Inflation Calculator (Vietnam)

This tool uses historical **Consumer Price Index (CPI)** data from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam to show how inflation affects your money's purchasing power.

### 1. Enter the Amount
Input the original sum of money you want to compare (e.g., the cost of a house 10 years ago).

### 2. Select Time Period
- **From Year**: The year the money was spent or earned.
- **To Year**: The target year for comparison (usually the current year).

### 3. Understanding the Results
- **Equivalent Value**: How much money you would need in the target year to buy the same goods/services as the original amount in the starting year.
- **Cumulative Inflation**: The total percentage increase in prices over the selected period.

### 4. Data Accuracy
The data is compiled from annual average CPI reporting. Note that real-world inflation for specific items (like real estate or healthcare) may differ from the general CPI.
