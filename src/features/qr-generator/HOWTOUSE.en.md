# How to use the QR Code Generator

A QR code (Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode that can be read easily by a digital device.

### 1. Enter Content
Type the text or paste the URL you want to encode into the textarea. The QR code will update when you click "Update QR".

### 2. Customize
- **Size**: Change the dimensions of the generated QR code (e.g., 512 for higher quality).
- **Error Correction**: 
  - **Low (L)**: Approx 7% recovery.
  - **Medium (M)**: Approx 15% recovery (Default).
